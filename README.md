IconCreator
===========

A simple python script that creates the right icon sizes for iOS apps.

How to use this script:

````bash
python iconcreator.py "path to image, should be 1024x1024"
````

If you want to use other resolutions, simply append or change the list.

````python
sizes = [152, 120, 80, 76, 58, 40, 29]
````
